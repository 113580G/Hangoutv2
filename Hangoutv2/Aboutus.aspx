        Hangout which will be established by the end of 2012 and is a Singapore based organisation which targets to market its name locally, which provides outdoor education and adventure learning programmes to help people realise their full 
        potential. Researchers have proved that since 1967, more than 250,000 people have benefited from their journey of self-discovery at camp oriented programmes and 
        emerged stronger both mentally and physically. Also through expeditions and outdoor activities, participants acquire new skills and a sense of adventure, develop the tenacity to overcome challenges as a team and 
        broaden their perspectives.
<p />
        Hangout guarantees the best facilities, training expertise and safety for the  participants. Participants can choose their own trainers for their camp programmes from our website. We include 
        the trainers biography, achievements and also the level of expertise so that we can garner our participant confidence that they will indeed have a great and fruitful time with what Hangout have in store for 
        them. Alternatively, we offer our participants a range of activities that we cater such as rock climbing, 
        flying fox, abseiling, etc.
